</h3>
ClipD is a program that helps protect you against clipboard-based cryptocurrency stealing attacks. It works by continuously monitoring your clipboard for any cryptocurrency-related strings (e.g. Bitcoin addresses) and alerting you if it detects any suspicious activity.

## Installation
To install ClipD, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release of ClipD from the [releases page](https://github.com/OnlyPunk/ClipD/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded file to a location of your choice.
3. Run the `ClipD.exe` file.
4. The tests start automatically, just run and watch the results!

## Usage
To use ClipD, simply run the program from the folder you extracted ClipD into. You can also create a Shortcut to put on your desktop to test efficently!

ClipD starts tests automatically, so you don't need to click around menus to figure everything out. Simply run and wait for the program to return a value (Secure or Not Secure).

### Not Secure
<b>NOO!</b> Sadly, you've been clipped, you need to fix this before copying and pasting addresses into your wallet program.
### Secure
<b>Yay!</b> There's nothing to worry about, ClipD detected no clipping, so you're safe to paste addresses!
